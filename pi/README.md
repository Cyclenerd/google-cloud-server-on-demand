# Raspberry Pi

A Raspberry Pi is used to send the command to create a VM after a button is pressed.

> **Note**
> I am using a Raspberry Pi 4 with Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) based on Debian version 11 (bullseye).
> An older Raspberry Pi 3 with 64-bit Linux should also work.

## Wiring

Wire the arcade buttons to the Raspberry Pi.

> I am using the [EG STARTS 30mm Arcade LED Buttons](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01N11BDX9/) from Amazon.de.
> They are designed for 5V, but they also work great with 3.3V from the Raspberry Pi.

RPi.GPIO:
```python
# LEDs
blue   = LED(26)
yellow = LED(19)
red    = LED(13)
green  = LED(6)

# Buttons
b1 = Button(17)
b2 = Button(27)
b3 = Button(22)
b4 = Button(23)
```

## Printer

Connect the thermal receipt printer via USB to the Raspberry Pi.

> I am using the [Hoin HOP-H58](https://www.hoinprinter.com/video/products-detail-906853) from eBay.
> Any printer that supports ESC/POS commands should work.

## Software

Copy the required scripts and programs to turn the Raspberry Pi into the "Shells on Demand Appliance".

> ** Warning **
> Perform these steps only after you have set up Google Cloud Platform as described in the [gcp](../gcp/) folder.

This is also automated. Run the following [Ansible playbook](./pi-soda.yml):

```bash
ansible-playbook "pi-soda.yml" \
-u "pi" \
-i [RASPBERRY_PI_IP],
```

> üíÅ Do not forget the comma (`,`) after the IP.

This is what the command looks like with my local IP from the Raspberry Pi:
```bash
ansible-playbook "pi-soda.yml" -u "pi" -i 192.168.100.155,
```

After Ansible has setup everything log in via SSH and do a reboot:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

## SODA

After a minute uptime, a script (`start.sh`) starts automatically in the background.
The script waits for the button input and sends a message via Pub/Sub.

Enter `soda` to get the script it in the foreground.

Use key combination <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>d</kbd> to get back to the normal terminal.

## Network

The network configuration is always configured via DHCP.

A fallback is configured for the LAN interface (`eth0`):

Static LAN IPv4: `100.100.100.100`

> ü§ì This is a IP from the for [carrier-grade NAT ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT) allocated address block.

Optionally, the Raspberry Pi can also act as an access Wi-Fi access point.
You need a second Wi-Fi interface (`wlan1`) for this and then you can connect to the Wi-Fi (name: `Shells on Demand Appliance`) and then access the Raspbery Pi via SSH.

> I am using the [HOMESPOT Wireless USB Adapter](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B01ERHE18S/) (with Realtek `RTL8188CUS` chip) from Amazon.de as second Wi-Fi adapter.

Static Wi-Fi access point IPv4: `100.100.200.200`

To enable the access point set the variable `wpa_passphrase` with a passphrase for the Wi-Fi:

```bash
ansible-playbook "pi-soda.yml" \
-u "pi" \
-e "wpa_passphrase=[WPA_PASSPHRASE]" \
-i [RASPBERRY_PI_IP],
```

The passcode must be at least 8 characters and at maximum 63 characters long.
